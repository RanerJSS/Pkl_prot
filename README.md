Short title: Proteomic profile of Moniliophthora perniciosa

Abstract
Moniliophthora perniciosa is a hemibiotrophic fungus that causes witches’ broom disease in cacao (Theobroma cacao L.). 
The biotrophic fungal phase initiates the disease and is characterized by a monokaryotic mycelium, while the necrotrophic phase is characterized by a dikaryotic mycelium and leads to necrosis of infected tissues. 
A study of the necrotrophic phase was conducted on bran-based solid medium, which is the only medium that enables basidiocarp and basidiospore production. Six different fungal developmental phases were observed according to the mycelium colour or the organ produced: white, yellow, pink, dark pink, primordium and basidiocarp. 
In this study, we identified notable proteins in each phase, particularly those accumulated prior to basidiocarp formation. Proteins were analysed by proteomics; 2-D gels showed 300-550 spots. Statistically differentially accumulated spots were sequenced by mass spectrometry and 259 proteins were identified and categorized into nine functional classes.
 Proteins related to energy metabolism, protein folding and morphogenesis that were potentially involved in primordium and basidiocarp formation were identified; these proteins may represent useful candidates for further analysis related to the spread and pathogenesis of this fungus. 
 To the best of our knowledge, this report describes the first proteomic analysis of the developmental phases of Moniliophthora perniciosa.
